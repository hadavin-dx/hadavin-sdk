"""Ported from WARDEN tests/test_redaction_classes.py (main a1e76cbf, the WARDEN repository). Kept 3 tests; dropped 1 that need WARDEN-only modules or unported gate policy (listed in the PR).

Every class the owner listed (2026-10-21) is masked, with a corpus for each - and the evidence WARDEN reasons from
is not: timestamps, resource names, a Kubernetes service's name, AWS's own host names, version strings, status codes.

Values are built from parts where their shape alone would trip a secret scanner (tests/fakes.py's rule)."""
