"""Copied from WARDEN tests/fakes.py (main a1e76cbf): the constants and helpers up to PlainKms.

Credential-shaped test fixtures, each built from parts at run time.

2026-10-16 (naming audit, items 5 and 16): a test that proves a secret is masked needs a value with the secret's
shape, and a literal of that shape in a tracked file is exactly what gitleaks, trufflehog, GitHub push protection
and scripts/check_publishable.py exist to stop. The publish check used to skip seven whole files to make room for
such literals, so a real secret pasted into any of those files would have been published unscanned. Joining the
parts gives the same string at run time, so every assertion keeps its meaning, and no file holds the literal.
tests/test_fixture_literals.py fails the day one comes back.
