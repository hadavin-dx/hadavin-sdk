"""G4 parity: no platform's write command reaches a person; reads and prose pass (lock-in audit 2026-10-31, §3d).

Every platform has a WRITE and a READ list, and `channel.clean` (the path approval text takes) must withhold every
WRITE item and change no READ or PROSE item. The WARDEN cases (tests/test_no_commands.py @ c78d7709) are ported
below with their names; the two WARDEN "kept" stories that are now withheld are listed in that test.
