"""`mounted_file` secrets: one file per secret in a mounted folder (no extra).

Works with anything that mounts secrets as files: a Kubernetes Secret volume, the Secrets Store CSI driver,
External Secrets, Docker/Swarm secrets, systemd credentials. `<dir>/<name>` is read, re-read after `ttl_s` (a
rotated mount is picked up), and one trailing newline is dropped. The path must stay inside the folder
(symlinks are resolved first, so Kubernetes' `..data` links work). On POSIX a file readable by every user is
refused, and so is one writable by its group or others: mount with `defaultMode: 0400` (or 0440 with an `fsGroup`),
not Kubernetes' default 0644. The checks run on the opened file (fstat), so nothing changes between check and read.

Neutral protocol: files in a mounted folder (the Kubernetes, Docker and systemd secret-mount convention).
