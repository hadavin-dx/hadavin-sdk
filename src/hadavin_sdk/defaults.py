"""The default numbers of the K5 read path, in one place.

Nothing here is a secret, an account id, a region or a host name. Every value is either validated config
(`Config.evidence`, `Config.retention`, `Config.tool_timeout_s`, the per-agent `max_run_usd`), a validated manifest
field (`max_output_bytes`, `ports`, `options`), or a validated source setting (`KubernetesSettings`); this file only
names the defaults those fields start from, so a number is never written twice. tests/test_no_hardcoded_values.py
keeps host names, account ids, ARNs and key-shaped strings out of `src/`.
