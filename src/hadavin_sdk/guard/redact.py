"""Pattern-based redaction for logs, audit and channel text (documents go to the model unredacted).

Copied from WARDEN `src/warden/redaction.py` at PR #206 head 14fc549 (branch `redaction-bank-patterns`,
veerarakesh56/warden): the full pattern table, including the bank codes (BANKCODE: BSB, sort code, ABA,
CA transit/institution) and accounts (BANKACCT), and the PHONE date guard. Edits: this header,
`RedactionResult.kinds` (the slice 1 callers read the kinds found), and a PHONE guard for compact
14-digit timestamps. Placeholders are `<KIND_n>`.
The WARDEN module notes follow.

Every string is scrubbed before it can reach the model. Patterns FIND values; a final sweep then masks
the other copies of each found value - every copy of a SECRET, every standalone copy of an identifier
(see _sweep). Strings that belong together (one incident's lines, labels, errors) are redacted as ONE
text: a value found in any of them is masked in all of them (redact_many, second review 2026-09-30).

⚠ What this is not (audit A-C-23): nothing here can see a secret NO pattern matches. The patterns are
the control; HIGHENTROPY is their backstop; the outbound gate's G5 re-runs them, independently, on
everything that leaves. (A re-scan inside redact() used the sweep's own rule and could never fire, so
it was removed - second review, 2026-09-30.)

# string) and the broader pattern then fails to match.

# surrounding structure (`password=<SECRET_1>`, `postgres://user:<URLCRED_N>@host`) so the model can
# still reason about the shape. A value that is nothing but placeholders (`api_key=<APIKEY_1>`) is masked
# already and left alone; one that holds a placeholder AND more (`password=<UUID_1>.more`) is masked whole and
# stored restored, so restore() gives it back in one step. Value classes used to stop at `<` instead, and left
# whatever followed a placeholder in clear (eighth review, 2026-10-01).
