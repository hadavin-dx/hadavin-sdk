"""``llm_judge``: a model screens untrusted text for injection (design 4.3, 12.1; kept by the owner).

The only cloud-agnostic model detector: it runs on any configured llm route and kind (Claude, Bedrock, Gemini,
or a local open-weights model on `openai_compat`), so regex + llm_judge is a production detector set with no
single vendor. Minimal on purpose: one fixed, versioned
prompt (``judge_prompt.md``, its hash is in ``config_hash``), a forced JSON verdict, metered (the cost rides on the
Verdict and the caller charges it), qualified by its own golden set (``golden_dir/judge.jsonl``, run by the evals
gate). A tripwire OR-ed with at least one other detector (config refuses a judge alone), never the default: the
judge reads attacker text, so it can itself be steered, and a "clean" from it never clears anything.

Neutral protocol: none of its own: it runs on whatever llm kind is configured (the `llm` capability).
