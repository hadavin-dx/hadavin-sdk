"""Platform secrets: the credentials a backend itself needs (a Slack token, a database DSN, an API key).

Kept apart from the executor's provider (design §4.4): a backend factory gets a ``resolve`` that reads only the
``*_secret_name`` values in its own settings, and no platform name may also be an action's executor secret.
``runtime/``, ``approvals/`` and ``llm/`` never import this module (tests/test_repo_rules.py).
