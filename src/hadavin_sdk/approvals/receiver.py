"""Inbound approval callbacks. Framework-free: ``handle_slack_action`` maps (headers, body) to (status, body).

It verifies the request, records the decision (``record_only``) and answers in well under Slack's 3 seconds.
It never executes: ``tick`` reconcile runs approved plans, so a Slack retry can never cause double work.
Production hosting is decided at S11; ``serve`` is a stdlib server for development.
