"""Bounded retries for every network llm kind (ported from WARDEN ``llm.py``; design 4.3).

Each SDK's own retries are off, so this loop is the only one. A transient failure is retried with exponential
backoff and full jitter, up to ``max_attempts`` requests in all; still failing, it is ``ProviderExhausted``.
Anything else (401 bad key, 400 malformed request) fails the same way every time, so it is a ``ProviderError``
at once.

Vendor-neutral (lock-in audit 2026-10-31, row 2): this module knows HTTP statuses, the standard library's network
errors and TLS, nothing else. Each kind knows its own SDK's errors and passes ``retryable(exc) -> bool | None``
(None: no opinion, the generic rule decides) and ``detail(exc) -> str`` (an error code safe to log).
