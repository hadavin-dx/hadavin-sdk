"""`chain` audit: an append-only hash chain in the store's database, with signed checkpoints and anchors.

Ported from WARDEN `audit.py` (main c78d7709): `_Store`, `AuditLog`, `_hash`, `_signed_message`, `verify` and its
checks, and the append-only `_PG_SCHEMA` pattern (here `store/migrations/0002_audit_chain.sql`). Edits: the
message prefix is `hadavin-audit`; rows are AuditEvents (hashes and codes only) and the AuditSink Protocol sits on
top; the signer and anchor come from the backend table; a checkpoint that cannot be signed or anchored is
logged and retried, never raised (signing is evidence, not a gate: design 4.8).

Three layers, because each one alone is beatable:
* **Append-only.** Triggers abort any UPDATE, DELETE or TRUNCATE. Anyone who can write the database can drop a
  trigger, so this is a guard rail, not proof.
* **Hash chain.** Each row's hash covers the previous row's hash and all of its own fields, so an edited,
  removed or reordered row breaks every link after it.
* **Signed checkpoints** every `checkpoint_every` rows, over `hadavin-audit:{seq}:{head}`. Someone who edits a
  row AND recomputes every later hash cannot recompute the signature; someone who also holds the key cannot
  rewrite the anchors (S3 Object Lock, written by another principal).

Honest limits: rows after the last checkpoint are chained but not yet signed (`verify` reports the tail). On
the `memory` store the chain is an in-memory SQLite database and is lost on restart, like the store.

Neutral protocol: SQL in the configured store (Postgres or the in-memory SQLite), signed with whichever signer is set.

    (possibly an ARN): it is accepted but never compared or printed, so an upgraded chain with old and new
    anchors is not a finding and no account id reaches the report.

    `names` (the object names exactly as listed, e.g. `anchors/000000000002.json`, same order as `bodies`): each
    must be `anchors.key(seq)` for the body's own seq, so an object copied under another name is a finding.

    Legacy anchors (written before `alg` existed) cannot say how they were signed. Upgrade path, no rewrite of
    the immutable objects: pass `assume_alg` (the scheme of the key that was configured then). The signature
    check against the public key is then the proof: a wrong guess fails every signature, never passes. Such a
