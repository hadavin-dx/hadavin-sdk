"""Checkpoint anchors in a Cloud Storage bucket with a retention policy (`pip install hadavin-sdk[gcp]`).

Each anchor is written with `if_generation_match=0` (only if no object of that name exists), and the bucket's
retention policy keeps it from deletion or replacement until it ages out. Checked at start-up: the bucket has a
retention period of at least `retain_days`; `COMPLIANCE` (prod with `retention_ack` only) also needs the policy
**locked**, so nobody can shorten or remove it. Signs in with Application Default Credentials; the identity
writing anchors must not be one that can delete them (S11).
