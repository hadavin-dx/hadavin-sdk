"""Checkpoint anchors in an S3 bucket under Object Lock (`pip install hadavin-sdk[aws]`).

Ported from WARDEN `audit.py` `S3Anchor` (main c78d7709). Edits: the lock mode comes from config (GOVERNANCE by
default, COMPLIANCE only in prod with `retention_ack`), and every put carries `IfNoneMatch="*"`, so an anchor is
never overwritten even before Object Lock applies (a 412 with the same bytes is an earlier put whose answer was
lost). The bucket must be written by a principal the runtime cannot delete with (S11): until the retention
ends, a history rewritten afterwards no longer matches its anchors.

Neutral protocol: the S3 object API with Object Lock, served by AWS S3 and by S3-compatible stores through `endpoint_url`
(MinIO, Ceph RGW). This module imports a vendor SDK (boto3), so it is the one allowed exception in
`test_every_neutral_kind_has_evidence`, which requires the `endpoint_url` setting instead.
