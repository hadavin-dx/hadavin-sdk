"""The CRM kind over a real HubSpot account (free plan), standard library only. Made-up leads only.

Everything this file says about how HubSpot answers is an assumption: no copy of HubSpot's documentation or posts is
stored in this repository, and the adapter is exercised against the demo server only.

The adapter is KEYED: asking again with the same lead id is harmless. HubSpot has no idempotency key, so the key is
the pair (email, the property `hadavin_lead_id` this adapter sets):
  put = create one contact; on 409 ("a contact with this email exists") read that contact back by id and compare its
        `hadavin_lead_id` with this lead's id: equal -> ALREADY_PRESENT (this is also how a create whose answer was
        lost is recognised on the retry), different or empty -> CrmEmailTaken (stored nothing, a person looks).
  Search is NOT used to decide a put: on the assumption that a new record can take some time to show in search
  (HubSpot's search documentation is not stored here), a search could say "absent" for a contact that exists. It is
  used only to count (wait_visible).

Error table (what the desk does with it: see Desk._crm_step):
  stored nothing (CrmNothingStored, the desk resets its mark and asks again later): not reached (refused, name
      lookup, certificate), 4xx other than 408/409 (CrmRefused: 400/401/403/404/422...), 429 after the bounded waits
      (CrmBusy), key file missing/empty (CrmConfigError), call cap reached (CrmCapReached), email taken by another lead.
  unclear (CrmError, the contact may exist; a keyed CRM is simply asked again): timeout, hang-up, 5xx, 408, a reply
      that is not the expected JSON.
The key is read from a file at every call and never logged, never in an error text, never in the file path text.
Only the contacts endpoints are used (read, create, search, list, archive); no property is ever created.
Every request is bounded as a WHOLE by a wall-clock budget (settings.timeout_seconds, at most the desk's call
deadline): the request (name lookup, connect, send, reading the answer) runs in a worker thread that the caller waits
for at most that long (`_once`). A worker that outlives it is abandoned: it ends on its own when its socket times out
(each read is also given only what is left of the budget), and its late answer is thrown away (a create that arrived
late is found again by the next put through the 409 check). One put shares one budget over its calls (the create and
the read-back after a 409); every read-back call has its own budget of the same size and the whole listing has one
total budget (LIST_TOTAL_SECONDS).
The base address must be an https host of the vendor's own domains (HUBSPOT_HOST_SUFFIXES in constants.py),
unless `allow_any_base_url` is set on purpose
(a local stand-in or a proxy of your own): the service key is sent to that host.
The per-run call cap lives in this process's memory: a restarted desk process starts with a fresh cap (a run script
that restarts the desk counts each process on its own and states the total).
Recycle bin (an ASSUMPTION: no copy of HubSpot's documentation is stored here,
and it was not exercised against a real account; public community posts describe a create that answers 409 with an
existing id while a plain read of that id answers 404): an ARCHIVED contact is taken to keep its email
reserved. That case is raised as CrmConflictUnreadable (unclear, loud): a person restores or
permanently deletes the contact in HubSpot, then the desk asks again.
Thread bound: an abandoned worker lives until its own socket times out (at most the request budget plus the
per-read timeout), so under a hang the number of live workers can exceed the number of callers; it is not counted or
capped here. The desk's descriptor budget (constants.py FD_RESERVE) must leave room for about three times its CRM
callers' worth of sockets; the per-run call cap bounds the total number of workers ever started.
Counters (`stats()`): what this adapter made, counted on the desk's side of the wire.
Copy of lead owner and lead stage (`set_fields`): PATCH on contacts by email is new; `/crm/v3/owners` is not used by
the desk (the probe lists owners once). The copy may use at most floor(max_calls * MIRROR_CALL_SHARE) calls of the run
(every PATCH attempt counts, 429 retries included), so the creates keep the rest; a PATCH past that share raises
CrmCapReached before anything is sent and is not counted."""
