# REPORT cloud session 3 (newest block on top)

## 2026-11-13 09:36Z / 15:06 IST  EGM SETUP PROOF (partial: dry run NOT done, needs a session reload)
FAILED / NOT DONE (first):
- Dry run (egm-review-loop with reviewers design and style) NOT run. The Skill and Agent lists of this running session were read at session start, before the install, so this session's Skill tool lists no egm:* skills and its Agent tool lists no egm:* agent types. I cannot reload them from inside the session (/plugin reload is a typed slash command). Needed from lead/owner: reload plugins or start a new session on branch demo/lane3, then I run the dry run. I did not substitute a general-purpose agent.
- `/plugin ...` slash commands cannot be typed by me; I used the equivalent CLI `claude plugin marketplace add google/elephant-goldfish-model` and `claude plugin install egm@egm` (both succeeded).
- Studio files templates\agents\BRIEF-PREAMBLE.md, bible\RULES.md, tools\hooks\agent_preamble_gate.py are NOT in the hadavin-sdk checkout (handover/BRIEF-PREAMBLE.md is). Not invented. The Agent-model hook mentioned in MODEL-ROUTING.md is therefore absent here; I set model on every Agent call by hand.
- Agent file names differ from the list in the order: the design reviewer file is design_critic.md with name egm-design (fine); plugin also ships extra egm-inventive-catalyst and egm-bootstrap-orchestrator.
DONE (with output):
- `claude plugin list`: egm@egm, Version 0.1.1, Scope user, Status enabled (note: "Default agents/ folder is ignored because the manifest sets agents").
- Claude Code version: 2.1.323 (>= 2.1.271).
- ~/.claude/settings.json now has model claude-sonnet-5-5, effortLevel medium, enabledPlugins egm@egm true, plus the extraKnownMarketplaces entry the install added.
- On disk the plugin has the 7 skills (egm-bootstrap, brainstorm, draft, drift-report, resolve, review, review-loop) and agent names egm-design, -codebase-details, -comprehension, -implementation-readiness, -structural, -style, -zoom-out, -synthesizer (+ bootstrap-orchestrator, inventive-catalyst).
- Ran handover/tools/egm_model_patch.py (read it first; it only edits model: lines and removes disable-model-invocation in the plugin cache): 70 files changed in 2 plugin folders. Check: `grep -rh ^model:` gives 6 claude-opus-5-5 (3 skills x 2 copies) and 64 claude-sonnet-5-5, no inherit; disable-model-invocation count 0 in all 7 cached skills. Needs a new session to take effect.
- Repo: demo/lane3 checked out (HEAD tracks origin/demo/lane3). Read BRIEF-PREAMBLE.md, MODEL-ROUTING.md, ORDERS.md. ORDERS NOT STARTED, waiting for GO.
- No secrets, no spend, no settings change on GitHub, no merge.
Register: no agents/shells/jobs running.
