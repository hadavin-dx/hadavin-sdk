"""The reveal: a person reads the real values behind an incident's placeholders (owner, 2026-10-20).

`/r/<incident>/masked` on the records site (the approval page's Lambda, approval_page._records):

- **Who.** A reader Slack named in this browser who may read the incident's records (the records page's own rule;
  nobody else learns that the incident exists) AND is an approver for its environment. A viewer
  (WARDEN_RECORD_VIEWERS) reads the record but never reveals (owner-safe default, review 2026-10-21); a passkey
  step-up for each reveal is an open owner decision.
- **What they see first.** The incident's masked values as the signed audit holds them: placeholder, kind and the
  stable pseudonym (vault.py) - enough to recognise and correlate, without a reveal.
- **The reveal.** The reader picks the values, gives a reason, and POSTs the form to the same address: the reason
  and the choice travel in the body, never in an address, a history or a proxy's log. The signed audit records it
  FIRST (`incident.reveal`: who, which values, why, the sealed row's hash) - no row, no value. Then the sealed map is
  opened with the vault key, which only this Lambda's role may use (kms:Decrypt, purpose=vault; CloudTrail records
  it too), and only the chosen values are shown, once, never cached (no-store), never in an address, never in Slack.
- **Forgery and abuse.** The form carries a token derived from the reader's own sign-in cookie, which no script and
  no other site can read: a page elsewhere cannot make a reader's browser reveal anything. A refused attempt (a
  forged or stale form, no value chosen, no reason, not an approver) is recorded too (`incident.reveal_attempt_refused`:
  who and why, never the token). At most MAX_PER_HOUR reveals and refused attempts per reader. The reason is redacted
  - whole, before it is cut to MAX_REASON - before it is recorded: a pasted secret is not kept.

No AI zone has a path here: no Temporal activity, MCP tool or command calls it, and no zone but this Lambda's can
open the key (tests/test_reveal.py, tests/test_vault.py).
