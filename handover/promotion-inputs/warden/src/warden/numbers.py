"""Numbers in what the model wrote, checked against the metrics WARDEN read (register M2).

A quote must be verbatim (P13), but the model's own prose is not a quote: "error rate 42%" over `error_rate=0.042`,
or "p99 latency 21 s" over `p99_latency_ms=2140`, is a misread a reader may act on. A number with a unit - a
percentage or a duration - that comes right after the words of a metric's name is put in one unit (fractions,
seconds) and must match that metric within 5%. A number that names no metric is left alone (an interval, a window,
a count), and so is one without a unit.

Measured 2026-10-03 on the published runs: compared with every metric of its kind, the check fired on 85 of 132
answers - mostly a CloudWatch percentage below one (CPU 0.0047 means 0.0047%) read as a fraction, and intervals
("15s") that are not metrics. Hence only named metrics, named by the words since the previous number ("cpu 43%, mem
65%": the 65% is not the CPU's); a value under one is accepted as either a fraction or a percentage; and a number
is allowed the rounding its own digits show ("0.005%" stands for 0.0045% to 0.0055%).
