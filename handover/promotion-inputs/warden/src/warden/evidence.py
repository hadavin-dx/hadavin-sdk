"""Evidence IDs: every item WARDEN gathered, numbered, so a claim can point at what supports it.

v2 Phase 1. The model used to write its evidence as free text ("error rate rose after the deploy"),
which nothing checked. Now each item has an id - L log, E Kubernetes event, M metric, D deploy,
T tool error - and a claim cites an id plus a span copied from that item (grounding.py checks both).

The ids are a pure function of the (redacted) ContextBundle, so the graph, the verifier and a replay
number the same evidence the same way without passing an index around.

Trust: L and E are text anyone who can make the application log can write, so they are UNTRUSTED:
the model never sees them, only the typed facts quarantine.py extracts (F items). M, D, T and C
(WARDEN's own structured reads of resource configuration and state) are shown as they are. The
alert's service and labels (Alertmanager rule config), the deploys, the metric resources and the C
items are the resource inventory a proposal's target must name (P14).
