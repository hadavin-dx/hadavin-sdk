"""The sealed vault: the real values behind an incident's placeholders, for people only (owner, 2026-10-20).

The read zone masks every value it finds (redaction.py) and, until now, threw the map away: the model was shown
`<EMAIL_1>` and nobody could ever learn which address it was. The map is now SEALED where it is made - inside
`prepare`, before it goes out of scope - and only a person can open it, through the reveal on the records page.

- **Sealed with a key no AI zone can use.** AWS KMS envelope encryption: a fresh data key per seal (GenerateDataKey,
  encryption context purpose=vault, the environment and the incident), AES-256-GCM over the map, the data key kept
  only wrapped. The vault key's policy (terraform/modules/warden-runtime/vault.tf) lets the read zone seal and ONLY
  the approval page's Lambda role open (kms:Decrypt, purpose=vault) - not the llm zone, not Eldane's critic zone,
  not the discussion chat's, not any zone a future agent runs in. CloudTrail records every Decrypt.
- **Never through Temporal, never in a log.** `seal` runs inside `prepare` and writes straight to the database; its
  result is not returned, so it never enters a workflow's history. Nothing here logs a value.
- **Stable ids people can correlate.** Each value also gets a pseudonym, `email:3f9a0c7d21b4`: an HMAC-SHA256 of its
  kind and value under the environment's own HMAC key, the same in every incident and revealing nothing. That key is
  a KMS HMAC key: it never leaves KMS, and only the read zone may use it (kms:GenerateMac). No zone holds kms:Decrypt
  on the vault key but the approval page's (owner, 2026-10-21). The model is shown placeholders only - never a
  pseudonym.
- **Retention, then gone.** A vault row expires WARDEN_VAULT_DAYS after it is sealed (default and minimum 180, the
  audit's own retention, register B19) and is deleted by the next seal. The signed audit keeps the index (placeholder,
  kind, pseudonym) and the sealed bytes' SHA-256 - what existed stays provable after the values are gone. An erasure
  is the database owner's; its procedure is in docs/DATA-EGRESS.md.
- **Personal data only.** Only the kinds in SEALED_KINDS (an email, a phone number, a tenant, an account id, an ARN,
  a UUID, an IP or MAC address, an internal host name, a person's name, a street address) are sealed. A credential,
  token, key, webhook, bank or card number, or a national id (a US SSN, an Aadhaar or PAN number) - NEVER_SEALED - is
  never kept: it is thrown away after masking, as before the vault (owner-safe default, review 2026-10-21). Every
  redaction kind is in exactly one of the two sets (tests/test_vault.py), so a new kind must be classified.

Without a vault key (a demo, a test with no KMS) nothing is sealed and the map is discarded, as before; a seal that
fails is recorded (`incident.vault_unavailable`, its type only) and the incident goes on - the values stay masked
either way; only the reveal is lost.
