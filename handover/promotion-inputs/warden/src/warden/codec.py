"""Encrypt every Temporal payload before it leaves the worker (AES-256-GCM).

Temporal stores every workflow input, activity input and result in its history, in plain form by
default. An alert carries identifiers WARDEN redacts everywhere else (people's emails, tenant ids),
and the history outlives the incident. With this codec, the Temporal server, its database and its
web UI hold only ciphertext; only a worker or client with the key can read a payload. Failure
messages and stack traces are encoded the same way (they can quote evidence too).

Key: `WARDEN_TEMPORAL_KEY`, 32 random bytes as base64 (Secrets Manager in the cloud, loadable through
settings.py). Every payload records which key encrypted it, and is bound (AES-GCM associated data) to
the namespace and workflow it belongs to. A payload that does not decrypt here - not encrypted, another
key, a forged or changed ciphertext, or one recorded in ANOTHER workflow - decodes to the REFUSED
marker, which no converter turns into a value. It never raises: the SDK decodes a whole activation at
once, so one bad payload would fail every task of its workflow (second review, 2026-09-30).

Honest limits:
- Workflow ids, activity and signal names, and timestamps stay in plain text; only payloads are
  encrypted.
- Payloads of one workflow id - of any slot, and of earlier runs of the same id - still decrypt in each
  other's place: the binding is namespace and workflow id only (third review, 2026-09-30). So nothing
  trusts an activity result for safety: `apply` re-reads WARDEN's own audit rows of its OWN run (plan,
  approvals, a clean precheck after them) and re-checks bounds and the kill switch; the workflow counts
  only an explicit empty gate or precheck answer as clean.
- Anyone who can complete a workflow's activity tasks can make it stop (an unreadable result fails its
  workflow task) - the same principals can terminate it outright. The watchdog for a remediation that
  never finishes is out of band (plan G6).
- A `Replayer` must be given the namespace the history was recorded in: its default namespace
  ("ReplayNamespace") binds nothing it replays, so every payload would be refused.

Rotation (register S4): payloads are always encrypted with the current key, and decrypted with whichever key their
metadata names - the current one or one of `WARDEN_TEMPORAL_KEY_PREVIOUS` (comma-separated, base64). A workflow
started before a rotation keeps reading its own history; drop the old key once no running workflow needs it
(docs/OPERATIONS.md).
