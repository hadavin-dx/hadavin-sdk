"""WARDEN's confidence in a diagnosis (owner U3-1, 2026-10-17): a level - low, medium or high - from checks WARDEN can
show a person, never the model's own number. A model's self-reported confidence is not calibrated (decide.py: 0.85 on
everything), so it is shown beside this level, never instead of it.

Each check is one fact WARDEN holds:
    grounded    every citation of the diagnosis, and of its chosen cause's own support, names a real item and quotes it
                (P13's test)
    decisive    the chosen cause rests on at least one held metric, deploy or configuration/state read (P34's test)
    separated   WARDEN's count of the chosen cause leads its best rival's by the margin (P35's numbers,
                grounding.separation)
    clear_lead  ... and by twice the margin
    complete    every read WARDEN tried returned (no failed read)
    signatures  a fix: one of WARDEN's own failure signatures describes what it read; no fault: none does
    consistent  the typed outcome agrees with the remediation (P37's test)

The level: low when the diagnosis is not grounded, not decided by WARDEN's own reads or not separated from its rival;
high when every check holds; medium otherwise. The rules were fixed before any measurement
and are never tuned on one. The records page, the report and model routing read the same dictionary.
