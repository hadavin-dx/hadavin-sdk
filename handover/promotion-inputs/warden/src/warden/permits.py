"""B12: the actor role's own permissions, checked before anyone is asked to approve a plan.

A plan a person approves and the actor role then cannot carry out wastes the approval, and its undo failing half-way
trips the kill switch. So when a plan is made (activities.resolve_plan, in the read zone), the AWS policy simulator
(iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy - read-only, nothing is changed) is asked whether the environment's actor role allows
the exact calls the fix will make: a plan it denies is refused before any approval request is sent.

The calls are the executor's own, never a list kept beside it that could drift: the entry's write code runs up to
its first call to AWS against an actor that records the session it asks for (actions, exact resources, condition)
and sends nothing (`trace`). The undo's calls are the same actions on the same resources, except where the undo is
another action (UNDO), or where nothing is undone (NO_UNDO); every AWS entry is in one of the three tables.

Honest limits:
- The simulator evaluates the role's identity policies, its permissions boundary and the organization's SCPs. It
  does not read resource policies (a KMS key policy, a queue policy) - a call those deny still fails at apply.
- A condition key WARDEN cannot supply leaves a call "unconfirmed": recorded and kept beside the plan, not a refusal.
  The keys supplied: the session's SourceIdentity (`inc-<id>`), the target's own environment tag (P18 already made it
  the plan's environment), every key in the session's own condition, and the IAM kill switch's tag
  (`aws:PrincipalTag/warden-kill-switch` = `off`, B18). The simulator does not read the role's own tags, and the
  switch's deny (iam/templates/kill-switch.json, `StringNotEqualsIfExists`) matches when the key is absent - so without
  it every call would read as denied or undecidable. The question asked is therefore "allowed while the switch is
  off": whether the switch is on is WARDEN's and the person's to see (scripts/iam_kill_switch.py status), not B12's.
- The check has a budget (BUDGET_S, run by `within`): a simulator or a read that hangs past it leaves the plan
  unconfirmed, so it never holds up resolve_plan (60 s). A read still running then sends nothing: the trace writes
  nothing, and the simulator only reads.
- A plan whose write code refuses while being traced is unconfirmed too: its apply refuses on its own.
- Only the AWS platform is checked: the Kubernetes and database platforms say "not checked".
