"""Where a path named on a command line may point (Sonar pythonsecurity:S8707, 2026-10-16).

An agent can drive WARDEN's command line and the repository's scripts, so a path taken from argv is untrusted: after
`..` and symlinks are resolved it must lie inside a place these tools work in - the working directory (the checkout),
the temp folder (and a CI job's RUNNER_TEMP), or one of the tools' own output folders in the home directory (bench runs,
AWS proof runs, the Wave 4 build). ~/.ssh, ~/.aws, /etc or a synced folder are refused, whichever way the path is
spelled - also when a tool runs from, or is pointed at, the home directory, which is then no place. Key files have
a folder of their own (audit.key_path). Stdlib only: the deploy jobs import this without installing the package, and
the benchmark harness loads this one file by its path without importing the tool under test. The tool names nothing of
the harness in return (tests/test_no_scenario_leakage.py).
