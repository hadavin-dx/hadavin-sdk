"""Success means the symptom is gone (B13), not only that the alarm left ALARM.

An alarm leaves ALARM for many reasons that are not a recovery: its metric stopped reporting, it went to
INSUFFICIENT_DATA, the evaluation window moved past one bad minute. And a fix can trade one failure for another: the
throttling stops and a new exception starts. So, after a fix, WARDEN reads the incident's own alarm itself:

- **The metric is no worse for N periods.** The alarm's own metric, statistic and period (a CloudWatch metric alarm;
  a Datadog metric monitor's query and evaluation window), read from the moment the fix was applied: every one of the
  last N complete periods must be on the healthy side of the alarm's own threshold. A breach in any period since the
  fix is "present"; fewer than N periods with none breaching is "unknown"; N clean periods is "gone".
- **No new error class.** The error classes (`SomethingError`, `SomethingException`, ...) in the service's error logs
  after the fix, against the same span of logs before it: a class seen only after the fix is "present".

Deterministic: the same reads give the same answer, from fixed rules - no model is asked. N is WARDEN_SYMPTOM_PERIODS
(default 3). The reading, its N and its numbers are recorded on the check's audit row. "unknown" never fails a fix by
itself - a good fix is never rolled back for want of a reading - but "present" does; the re-checks after a verified
fix (15 and 60 minutes, register C18a) read again, by when N periods exist.
