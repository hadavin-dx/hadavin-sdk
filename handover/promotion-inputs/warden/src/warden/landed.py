"""B21: before WARDEN undoes its own fix, it looks for anything else that landed on the target since the fix.

An undo puts back what the plan's snapshot recorded. If a deploy, a merged change or another person's write reached
the target after WARDEN's fix, the undo may write over it - or bring back a state that no longer fits the code now
running. So before a rollback (activities.rollback) WARDEN reads, from the time its fix was applied until now:
- write events on the target in CloudTrail, through the environment's platform reader - any principal but this
  incident's own actor session (its fix, its canary);
- WARDEN's own fixes of the same target by another run (the audit);
- GitHub deployments to the environment and pull requests merged into its branch (WARDEN_CHANGE_REPO, read with
  WARDEN_GITHUB_TOKEN) - only where this worker holds the token.
Anything found, or a source that is configured and cannot be read, and the fix is not undone: a person decides.

Every read is whole or it is unknown: CloudTrail is looked up by the target's own names page by page, GitHub's lists page
by page back to the fix, and a read that runs past its pages is "could not be read". What landed is kept redacted.

GitHub is read through warden.web.urlopen, as every credentialed call is: a redirect to another host is refused and
read as "could not be read", never followed with the token.

Honest limits:
- CloudTrail can take minutes to show an event, so a write in the last minutes may not be seen yet.
- CloudTrail is looked up by resource name (LookupEvents, ResourceName), and that index holds only the resources an
  event lists. A write whose event lists no resource, or names the target some other way, is not found.
- A short name is matched as it is: a write on another resource with the same name (a queue and a function both
  called `orders`), or by an AWS service acting on the target (Auto Scaling, a service-linked role), counts as
  landed. That errs toward not undoing: a person decides.
- A platform with no change reader (Kubernetes, a database) reads no CloudTrail - the record says so ("unchecked") -
  and its undo still refuses on its own when the field it restores moved (the platforms' own checks).
- The branch a change merges into is taken to be the environment's name, as WARDEN's own repository is laid out
  (dev, prod).
