"""B20: one writer per target - a lock in the audit, durable across workers, and on the record.

Before this, two fixes of one resource were kept apart by the workflow id (`rem-<env>-<target hash>`: one open run per
id) and by the bounds' cool-down, which reads the applied rows and then writes its own: two workers could both read
"nothing applied" and both apply. Now a run takes the target's lock as it applies (activities.apply), with a
check-and-set inside the audit's own write lock (AuditLog.append_unless), so of two runs only one holds it - whichever
worker, process or starter runs them - and the other is refused before anything is changed.

The key is the plan's target, `<environment>/<platform>:<resource>` (catalog.target_key), the key the bounds use.
A lock is held until its run ends (that run's `workflow.end` row - every end, recovered or not, writes one), or until
TTL passes: a run whose end row was never written does not hold its target for ever. The TTL is
longer than the longest run holding one: the verify window (at most 2 h), its re-checks and a day's soak.
Each take and each refusal is a row: who held the target, from when, and who was turned away.
