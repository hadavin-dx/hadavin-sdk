"""Which Claude model answers (owner, 2026-10-17): Claude Sonnet 5.5 by default, Claude Opus 5.5 only for a HARD case.

"Hard" is decided by WARDEN's own checkable signals - never by what a model says of itself (its confidence, its tone,
its own claim that a case is difficult). Each signal is computed from data WARDEN holds and can show:

    risk tier         the proposed fix's catalogue tier is one of HARD_TIERS (T2, T3)
    prod              the incident's environment is of the prod tier (environments.yaml)
    disagreement      the two independent diagnoses of the same evidence name another action or another target
    too close         WARDEN's count of the top two hypotheses' held citations differs by less than the margin
                      (needs ranked hypotheses; until they exist the signal is recorded as not available)
    weak evidence     fewer than MIN_OWN_READS of the diagnosis's held citations are WARDEN's own reads (a metric,
                      a deploy, a configuration or state read), or the gathered evidence is thin by P9's own count
    re-investigation  a person asked for one in the discussion channel: a "new plan" (the new incident's alarm is on
                      the record as started from the chat), or a question with DEEP_QUESTION's words

One signal is enough; with none, the default model answers. Every choice goes on the signed audit with the signals,
their values and the rule each was held to (`incident.route`, `discuss.route`). Where it is applied:

- diagnosis: before the first answer, on what is known then (prod, re-investigation, gathered evidence); after the
  answer is verified, on all of them - and when the case turns out hard, Opus takes the diagnosis over (activities,
  workflows). A takeover's answer is checked like any answer; it never lifts an escalation the disagreement caused;
- Eldane, the AI critic, always uses the OTHER model than the one that made the incident's diagnosis (other_model);
- the discussion channel: a simple question gets the default model, a deep re-investigation the hard one.

The models are configuration (data/providers.yaml `routing`), and each must still be qualified (register M20) to be
used: a hard case whose model is not qualified is answered by the default model, and the record says so. Opus costs
twice Sonnet per token (providers.yaml `prices`); the incident's USD and call ceilings (llm.py) count every call at its
own model's price, so a takeover the budget cannot pay for is not made: the earlier answer stands, held for a person.
