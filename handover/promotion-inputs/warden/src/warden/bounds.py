"""Bounds, the kill switch and the circuit breaker - all read from the audit log.

`blocked()` lists every reason an apply must not happen. It runs at the gate, before the approval wait,
AND again inside `apply` itself - a kill switch tripped during the wait used to be missed (third review,
2026-09-30):
- the kill switch is on;
- this service already had `per_service_per_hour` applies in the last hour;
- this action class already had `per_class_per_day` applies in the last day.

After each apply, `record_result()` writes whether the workflow's OWN success check passed. When
`breaker_failures` of them failed within `breaker_window`, it trips the kill switch: something is
going wrong repeatedly, and the right move is to stop and get a person.

The kill switch is turned off only by `reset()` with a valid signed approval whose plan hash is the
hash of the trip row itself - an approval for one trip cannot clear another.

The state lives in the audit log, so it is as tamper-evident as the rest of the record, and there is
no second store to fall out of step with it.

ponytail: counts are read by scanning the audit rows in the window; an index on (kind, at) when the
log gets large.
