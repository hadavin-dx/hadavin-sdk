"""Expected to be down: an alarm on something a person declared off, or not in use, is not an incident.

Owner, 2026-10-12: non-production environments are shut down at night for cost - "that is expected state, not an
incident" - and "not only night shutdown, even sometimes on holidays and weekends and some other times when not
needed, and maybe even complete or temporary not using those environments or AWS services or application services".

A declaration says WHAT (environments, services, resources - every one given must match the alarm) and WHEN (every
one given must hold; none given means always):

    - name: dev nights
      environments: [dev]
      zone: Asia/Kolkata
      hours: "20:00-08:00"          # wall-clock, may cross midnight
    - name: dev weekends
      environments: [dev]
      zone: Asia/Kolkata
      days: [sat, sun]
    - name: Diwali
      environments: [dev]
      zone: Asia/Kolkata
      dates: ["2026-11-08", "2026-11-09"]
    - name: reports service parked
      services: [reports]
      zone: Asia/Kolkata
      until: "2026-11-01T09:00"     # `from` and `until` bound it; neither means until the declaration is removed
    - name: old search cluster, not in use
      resources: [search-v1]

Read from WARDEN_EXPECTED_DOWN (the runtime loads it from Parameter Store). The opposite of a change freeze: a
declaration that cannot be read covers NOTHING, so a typing mistake brings the alarms back and never hides one.
While an alarm is covered no incident starts; when the cover ends, the alarm is looked at again and, still firing,
becomes an incident then (intake.py). Declared by a person: WARDEN infers no schedule.
