"""The Signals layer and the mock reasoning branches.

The eval suite runs the four FIXTURE incidents through the whole graph, but the cluster-shaped
branches - the ones a live Kubernetes backend triggers - had no direct test. `bad_deploy` in
particular was added so a live incident (a recent image change plus a crash loop, no OOM) can reach
the rollback verdict; nothing exercised it. This tests the derivation and every branch, cluster
shape included, at the level where the bug would live.
