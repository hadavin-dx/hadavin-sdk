"""End to end (owner, 2026-10-20): the bundled incidents' evidence - which carries real-looking emails, addresses,
tenant and account ids on purpose - through the diagnosis prompt, the report, every chat sink, a page and the change
record: no raw value reaches any outbound payload or any log line, and an identifier shown "for the operator" is
refused at Slack's door. Every egress is on the ledger (#104), and no ledger row holds a value; a Lambda's log lines
and its uncaught error pass the log gate (#110); the values are sealed where found and only an approver's reveal,
on the signed audit first, opens them (#115, #119).

Every request a sink makes goes through a stand-in for urllib's opener that runs egress.check_request on exactly the
bytes the sink built, then answers 200 - nothing leaves the test."""
