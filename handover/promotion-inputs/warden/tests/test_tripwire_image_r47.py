"""The cloud runtime carries the injection tripwire (register R47, 2026-10-14).

Prompt Guard 2 was measured on a laptop for weeks while the cloud image had no detector and every environment had it
off (owner, 2026-10-14: "doing things on local and missing them on cloud"). These pin each link: the guard extra in
the image with CPU-only torch, the pinned weights fetched at build with the token as a build secret and checked against
the measured copy, offline use at run time, the token's place in the pipeline, the read zone sized for the model, and
the detector on in every environment.
