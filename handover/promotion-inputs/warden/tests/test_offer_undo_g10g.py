"""Held by P31 alone, WARDEN offers the undo of the change the proposal left unaddressed (first live fault,
2026-10-11). A person cut a table's write capacity; the model proposed raising it - which WARDEN's bounded raise could
not even reach - P31 held that, and the person received a hand-off and no plan, although the undo of that very change
has an entry. The offer goes through the same resolver and the same live read as a proposed revert, and a person
approves it; beside any other policy nothing is offered."""
