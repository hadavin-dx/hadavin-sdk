"""A fix that was verified and whose alarm fires again hears it at once (register G10-28; live, 2026-10-12).

The lab's schedule was fixed and verified, then switched off again. Its alarm fired - and reached nothing: intake
matched an alarm to an open fix by the alert's `service` (the ALARM's name here) against the plan's (the RULE's), and
told only a fix still in its verify window. The watch slept on to its 15-minute re-check, the new incident's plan was
silently not opened, and nobody was told of the relapse until then."""
