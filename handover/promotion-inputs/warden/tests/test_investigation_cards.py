"""B37: the investigation card and the notes learned from related records, on an incident's record page.

Both are read from WARDEN's own signed rows only: the card from the incident's rows, the notes from how its related
records (a person's links, WARDEN's found links) ended. Every text is redacted and escaped; nothing comes from the
