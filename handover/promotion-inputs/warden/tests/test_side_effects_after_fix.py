"""Owner, 2026-10-15: "in real time the fixes might break things or cause even bigger other problems ... so everything
should be tracked and verified and double checked", and "we don't know if it is because of that issue or not, so we
can't say directly, but can investigate and compare and link them".

- Another alarm in the environment that starts while one of WARDEN's fixes is verified or watched starts its own
  incident as any alarm does (connected or not is for its diagnosis to say, with the fix beside its evidence) - and the
  fix is told: it is not called fixed and held, and it is not undone on its own.
- A fix that fails a re-check with no alarm to start an incident is diagnosed again by WARDEN itself - the cause, the
  fix, the plan - from what it reads now."""
