"""The operator IAM policies, checked for the mistakes that only show up in the AWS console.

⚠ WHAT THIS CANNOT DO. It cannot tell you an action name is real — only AWS knows the full list, and
it changes. `budgets:DescribeBudget` looked perfectly plausible and does not exist; it was caught by
the IAM console's own validator when the policy was pasted in, which is the authoritative check and
must still be run.

What it DOES catch is the class of bug that the console will happily accept and that then fails at
`terraform apply` with a confusing AccessDenied:

  - a GLOBAL service's actions sitting under an `aws:RequestedRegion` condition, which does not
    narrow the grant, it silently voids it. This was written wrong twice, in two files.
  - a statement carrying keys IAM does not accept, e.g. a `_comment` field.
  - a region drifting out of sync with `variables.tf`, which denies every call for a reason the
    error message does not mention.
