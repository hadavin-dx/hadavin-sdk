"""Register S9 (supply chain) and G6: WARDEN's own runtime pipeline, .github/workflows/runtime.yml. The image is built
before the job holds a credential, pushed by the commit's SHA, signed by digest with cosign (keyless, this workflow's
own identity) and given build provenance; the deploy verifies both - signed by this workflow on the runtime branch -
before it plans, and applies only the plan it made, with that digest. terraform/runtime takes every per-install value
from SSM. The pipeline runs from environments.yaml `github.runtime_branch` only (owner, 2026-10-16: dev, until prod
exists), at a commit promoted onto it from its upstream branch."""
