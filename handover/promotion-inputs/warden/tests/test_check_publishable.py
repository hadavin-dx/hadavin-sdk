"""The publishability checker, tested against things it MUST refuse.

A secret scanner that has only ever been shown clean input has not been tested — it has been
admired. Every test here hands it something that must fail, because the day this matters is the day
a real credential is sitting in a file, and "it printed clean" is exactly what a broken scanner does.

The second half tests the *other* failure mode, which is the one that actually kills these tools in
practice: **crying wolf.** A checker that flags ordinary text gets bypassed within a week, and a
bypassed checker is worse than none because it also provides false comfort.
