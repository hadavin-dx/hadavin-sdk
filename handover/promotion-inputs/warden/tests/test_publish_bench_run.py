"""Publishing a benchmark run must ship the rubric that run was graded under.

⛔ Why this file exists. `scenarios/scoring.yaml` is one file for every wave, so the day a later
wave adds a fault class, its hash stops matching every already-published run and re-scoring them
raises "THE RUBRIC CHANGED AFTER THIS RUN" - the loudest warning this project has, fired for a
change that never touched the entries those runs were graded by. A bundle that carries its own
rubric can always be re-scored exactly, and that property is worth a test rather than a habit.
