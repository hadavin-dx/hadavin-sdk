"""Against REAL databases. Skipped unless opted in; FAILS (never skips) if opted in and the database
you named is unreachable.

    WARDEN_DB_INTEGRATION=1 WARDEN_TEST_PG_DSN=postgresql://... pytest tests/integration -q

Each engine is configured by its own DSN variable, and an engine with no DSN set is simply not part of
this run:
    WARDEN_TEST_PG_DSN     postgresql://warden:<password>@localhost:55432/warden
    WARDEN_TEST_MYSQL_DSN  mysql://root:<password>@localhost:53306/warden
    WARDEN_TEST_REDIS_DSN  redis://localhost:56379/0
    WARDEN_TEST_MONGO_DSN  mongodb://localhost:57017/warden
    WARDEN_TEST_MSSQL_DSN  mssql://sa:<password>@localhost:11433/master

⛔ The distinction that matters: a DSN that is SET but unreachable is a FAILURE, not a skip. "You told
me this database exists" and "it answered" are different claims, and a green run must only ever mean
the second one. This is the same discipline as test_live_cluster.py.

What this proves that the unit tests cannot: that the statements are valid against the real server's
grammar and catalog views, and that after `terminate` the stuck connection is ACTUALLY GONE — not that
a stub recorded a string.

Every test is self-contained: it opens its own victim connection and cleans up after itself.
