"""Against a REAL cluster. Skipped unless opted into; FAILS if opted into and the cluster is absent.

    WARDEN_K8S_INTEGRATION=1 pytest tests/integration -q

Preconditions (the CI `k8s` job sets them up; locally: `k3d cluster create` then
`kubectl apply -f k8s/test/oom-workload.yaml` and wait for an OOMKilled status):
  - a kubeconfig that reaches a cluster
  - the synthetic OOM workload deployed as Deployment `checkout` in `default`

⛔ Review finding: the first version SKIPPED when `KubernetesBackend()` raised, so with the opt-in
set and no cluster every test skipped and the step was green. Opting in means "there IS a
cluster"; an unreachable one is a failure, and the CI step additionally asserts a pass count.

What this proves that the unit tests cannot: the real client's response shapes, the real kubelet's
termination reasons, the real events stream - and that the whole pipeline, run against them,
reaches the verdict the fixture version promised.
