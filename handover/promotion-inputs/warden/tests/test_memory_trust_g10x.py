"""Memory, runbooks and references that may have been tampered with (register G10-48).

Owner, 2026-10-14: "be cautious with memory, company runbooks and references - they may be tampered". Researched the
same day (MINJA, AgentPoison, ShadowMerge, the Misattribution Gap: a model-written memory turns one hostile input into
trusted context for every later incident). WARDEN keeps no memory a model writes: what it keeps are facts on its
signed record, and the evidence of ONE incident, kept to answer questions about that incident only. Its reference
knowledge changes only by a reviewed commit (N9), and every place that reads text from outside is a known one."""
