"""The wave loop, against a stubbed AWS account and a stubbed WARDEN.

⚠ WHAT THESE PROVE, STATED PLAINLY. They prove the wiring: that WARDEN is handed the identity it is
supposed to be limited to, that the account is put back even when things go wrong, and that a wave
stops rather than publishing contaminated results. They prove **nothing** about AWS. A guard that
passes against a fake proves the request was made, not that the outcome was right — this project has
already had a `resourceVersion` precondition pass every unit test and then be rejected by a live
cluster.

The two that matter most are `test_warden_never_sees_the_operators_credentials` and
`test_a_failed_revert_stops_the_wave`, and both are written adversarially: the fake is set up to
fail, and the assertion is about what the runner does about it.
