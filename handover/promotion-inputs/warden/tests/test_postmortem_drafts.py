"""Item 16b: a postmortem draft on the records page, built only from the incident's signed record.

Each test builds a record from audit rows as WARDEN writes them, and reads the draft as a person would: marked a
draft, the one root cause WARDEN named (or "not established"), what was done and what verified it, times in UTC with
the display zone, no false alarm for a planned shutdown, next steps per team, and nobody shown by the list's id."""
