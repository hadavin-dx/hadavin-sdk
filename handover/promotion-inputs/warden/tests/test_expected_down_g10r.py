"""An alarm on something a person declared down, or not in use, is not an incident (register G10-39).

Owner, 2026-10-12: non-production environments are shut down at night - "that is expected state, not an incident" -
and "not only night shutdown, even sometimes on holidays and weekends and some other times when not needed, and
maybe even complete or temporary not using those environments or AWS services or application services".

While a declaration covers an alarm no incident starts. When the cover ends the alarm is looked at again: a
shutdown that did not come back is an incident then, dated then."""
