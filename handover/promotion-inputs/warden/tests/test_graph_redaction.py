"""The redaction WIRING in the graph, not the redactor itself.

`redact()` is well tested in test_redaction.py. This file guards the thing an adversarial review
actually found broken: the graph fed the model `recent_deploys` WITHOUT redacting them, so an
identifier the redactor masks in a log line (an AWS account id embedded in an ECR image ref, a
deployer email) reached the LLM in the clear via `_evidence_blob`. The unit test below is the
regression: the assembled prompt must carry no raw identifier from ANY field.
