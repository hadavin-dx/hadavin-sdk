"""Fixtures several test files share, offered to every test as a plugin: tests/conftest.py's pytest_configure
loads it with `config.pluginmanager.import_plugin("shared_fixtures")` when the approval extra (webauthn) is installed,
and not in the lean CI jobs that do not install it, where none of these fixtures is used.

Each stays defined in the file it belongs to; a file that needs one of another file's fixtures asks for it by
name and no longer imports it, so no import has to be hidden from the linter (F401/F811 suppressions). A file's
own fixture of the same name still wins inside that file.
