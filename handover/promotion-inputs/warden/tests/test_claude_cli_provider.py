"""The `claude` CLI provider, against a stubbed subprocess.

⛔ THE TWO THAT MATTER are `test_every_tool_is_disabled` and
`test_it_runs_outside_the_repository`. A headless Claude launched inside this repo can read files,
and `scenarios/catalog/` holds the fault classes while `scenarios/scoring.yaml` holds the answer key.
A diagnosing model that can grep those is not being measured — it is looking the answer up, and the
whole benchmark becomes worthless in a way no result would reveal.

Both defences are asserted here because "we passed the flag" and "the flag is still there after
somebody refactors this" are different claims.
