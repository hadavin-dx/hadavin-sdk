"""The report carries the evidence and the affected identifiers - and leaks nothing.

⛔ The leak tests come first because the first version of this feature leaked. It restored the real
values into the model's text and redacted again; the model had written `tenant_<TENANT_1>`, which
became `tenant_initech-4`, which no redaction pattern recognises - so a tenant id went out with
identifiers switched OFF. The tests below drive the whole pipeline on bundled incidents, with the
model's text containing exactly that kind of glued-on placeholder.
