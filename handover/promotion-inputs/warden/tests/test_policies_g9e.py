"""G9-E (2026-10-10): the policies that blocked correct answers (audit-coverage-limits E1, E3), changed only where it
is safe - P5 counts a configuration-only revision as a deploy (tests/test_aws_backend.py). P29 (a benign failed read
is not P8's partial picture) was observed beside P8 until the owner enforced it on 2026-10-11, after three held-out
runs: 19, 22 and 21 more right fix plans reached the approver and no wrong one."""
