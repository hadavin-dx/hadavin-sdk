"""ChatOps against a REAL HTTP server — the transport, not a mock of it.

Every other ChatOps test stops at the sink boundary: it asserts what `send()` was handed. That leaves
the last mile unproven — that `urllib` actually POSTs, that the JSON shape is what a webhook receives,
that a non-2xx is reported as undelivered rather than raised, and (the one that matters) that what
crosses the wire is REDACTED.

This runs a throwaway `http.server` on localhost and points the sinks at it. No network egress, no
credentials, nothing external — but it is a real socket, a real request and a real response, so the
claim "the payload that leaves is redacted" is tested where it is actually made.
