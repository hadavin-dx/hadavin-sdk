"""The Wave 3 harness wiring: the environment WARDEN is given, and the gate before each scenario.

⛔ Half of this file is about ONE fact: the DSN carries the proving-ground database's master
password. It has to reach the tool under test and must reach nothing else - not the manifest, not
the ground truth, not an argv, not a log line. Wave 1 and Wave 2 handed out a temporary role ARN,
which is not a secret; this wave is the first that hands out a credential in plain text, so the
places it could leak get a test each rather than a comment.
