"""WARDEN prints no runnable write command anywhere a person reads it (owner, 2026-10-16).

The commands audit (2026-10-16) found reports still printing exact aws, kubectl and SQL commands - a runbook's
fix and undo, "Fix - exact commands", "Candidate fix - NOT APPROVED", every pattern's `fix` - even under a
rejected verdict, some with masked values written back into them. All of it went into the records page and the
webhook's data. A fix now goes only through a catalogue plan and a signed approval, which WARDEN applies itself.

Held here over every bundled demo alert and the full-stack fault fixtures, for every verdict: no report's
markdown or data holds a write command or a command key, no pattern's advice holds one, and a model's prose -
in a report or a discussion answer - has its commands withheld by the gate's G4.
