"""Register S15: the trust zones. Every activity belongs to exactly one zone; a workflow on the main queue sends each
to its zone's queue (read: the readers, llm: the model, notify: paging and chat, act: the actors; the audit's own
steps stay with the workflows), and a zone's worker serves only that zone - so a zone's process needs only that zone's
credentials and its own Temporal service account. A workflow on another queue keeps every activity with it."""
