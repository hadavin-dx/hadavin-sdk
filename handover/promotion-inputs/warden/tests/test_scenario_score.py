"""The scorer, against hand-built reports.

The scorer is the part a hostile reader will re-run themselves, so every branch of it is pinned
here: each of the four diagnosis outcomes, both gate columns, `NO-EVIDENCE`, `ERROR`, and each of
the six evidence assertion kinds.

⛔ The one that matters most is `test_an_unknown_assertion_kind_raises`. An assertion kind the
scorer does not understand must never be treated as passing — that is how an evidence score becomes
decorative and a broken backend scores well.
