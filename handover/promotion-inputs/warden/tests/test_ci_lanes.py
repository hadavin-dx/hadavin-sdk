"""Every integration test must be claimed by a CI job.

The integration suites each need their own infrastructure — a k3d cluster for the Kubernetes files,
service containers for the database file — so CI runs them in separate jobs, each naming its files
explicitly. That creates a silent-failure mode worth guarding: **a new file in `tests/integration/`
that no job runs**. It would be green everywhere, forever, having never executed.

This is the same failure this repo has been bitten by before — a check that passes because nothing
ran. It cost a real CI failure when `test_live_database.py` was added to a directory the Kubernetes
job ran wholesale with a zero-skips assertion.
