"""Versioning of `hadavin.demo-export/1`: additive minors.

Rules (the migration contract, tested in `tests/test_versioning.py`):
1. The `schema` string stays `hadavin.demo-export/1` for every minor. A reader that knows minor N reads every export
   of minor 0..N. An export that declares a minor above the reader's `MAX_MINOR` is refused (`UNSUPPORTED_MINOR`).
2. `schema_minor` is optional; absent means 0 (the shape first published on the branch, frozen copy in
   `fixtures/compat-v1.0/`). Every export in that frozen set keeps validating.
3. A minor ADDS: optional keys, enum values, a new chain format. It does not remove or retype a key, make an old key
   required or narrow an enum. `additive_diff` checks that against the frozen copy (it also flags raised bounds, changed
   patterns, tightened additionalProperties and any combinator it cannot prove only loosens). The reviewed exceptions
   (five unprovable loosenings, three tightenings) are listed with reasons in `ACCEPTED_TIGHTENINGS`; nothing else passes.
4. A key or enum value introduced in minor N may appear only in an export that declares `schema_minor >= N`
   (`MINOR_TOO_LOW`). That is how an old reader's refusal is predictable instead of accidental.
5. Rules that need a new field (tenant on every record, honesty kind present, hash-chain/2) apply from the minor that
   introduced them. The general limits (document size, string length, nesting depth, unique hard-zero keys, the
   confident_on_abstain de-duplication) apply to every minor: the minor-0 shape existed only on the unmerged branch
   kit/portal-kit (no exporter outside it), so no published export could be invalidated; that is a choice, not a property
   of the mechanism.
6. `migrate(doc)` upgrades a minor-0 export to the latest minor ONLY when the data to do so honestly is present; it
   never invents a tenant, a terminal state or a measurement. It returns the problems it could not close.
7. STATUS: minor 1 is DRAFT until a real demo exporter passes `kitcheck` on its own output. Until then it may change
   incompatibly, announced in the pull request. A change that must break readers gets a new schema string (/2).
